products.aggregate(pipeline:[
  // filters the documents in the products collection based on specific conditions. It checks for documents where the status field matches a certain value (?) and the vaccineCode is in a specified array of values (not detailed).
  {$match:{status:?,vaccineCode:{$in:[?,?,?]}}},
  

  // $lookup stage: performs a join with another collection (name not provided) to merge additional data into the pipeline. A variable productId is defined (exact field not specified) to be used in the sub-pipeline for matching. The sub-pipeline inside this $lookup stage further filters documents based on complex conditions combining multiple fields with $eq and $gte operators.
  {$lookup:{from:?,let:{productId:?},
  pipeline:[{$match:{$expr:{$and:[{$eq:[?,?]},{$eq:[?,?]},{$eq:[?,?]},{$gte:[?,{}]}]}}}],as:?}},
  
  // $unwind stage: deconstructs an array field from the joined documents to output a document for each element. The path specifies the field to unwind (not specified), and preserveNullAndEmptyArrays controls the inclusion of documents where the path is null, missing, or an empty array.
  {$unwind:{path:?,preserveNullAndEmptyArrays:?}},
  

  // $project stage: controls the inclusion, exclusion, or addition of fields. The provided field mappings (fhirLocationId, productId, channels, vaccineName, vaccineCode, daysOfWeek, effectiveDates, _id, matchingProducts.category) dictate the structure of the output documents, indicating which fields should be included from the processed documents.
  {$project:{fhirLocationId:?,productId:?,channels:?,vaccineName:?,vaccineCode:?,daysOfWeek:?,effectiveDates:?,_id:?,matchingProducts.category:?}}])

  // in short: the aggregation query filters, joins, and formats data from the products collection. It filters products based on their status and vaccine codes, joins additional details from another collection based on product ID, and then formats the output to include specific fields like location ID, product ID, vaccine details, and others. The query is structured to support dynamic input values for flexible use.
